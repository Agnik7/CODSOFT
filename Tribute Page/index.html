                    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most brilliant mathematicians in history. He was born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, and he passed away on April 26, 1920, in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India, at the young age of 32.</p>
                    <p>Ramanujan made significant contributions to various areas of mathematics, particularly in number theory, mathematical analysis, and modular forms. His work was characterised by its depth and originality, and he often produced results that were previously unknown to the mathematical community.</p>

                    <li class="item">Ramanujan never received any formal training in Mathematics.</li>
                    <li class="item">He had discovered a number of theorems independently, some of which were later proved by other mathematicians.</li>
                    <li class="item">Ramanujan was a vegetarian.</li>
                    <li class="item">He was a child prodigy, showing his mathematical prowess from as early as age 11.</li>
                    <li class="item">He had a difficult start to his career because, although he excelled in mathematics, he would fail in non-mathematical subjects.</li>
                    <li class="item">Ramanujan's love for Mathematics started with the book <b>A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics</b> by G.S. Carr.</li>
                    <li class="item">Ramanujan was the second Indian to be elected to the Royal Society Fellowship, after Ardaseer Cursetjee Wadia</li>

                        <li class="item">One of the most famous contributions of Ramanujan was the <b>Ramanujan Hardy Number.</b> Once Hardy came to meet Ramanujan, and said that the taxi he took had a rather dull number, 1729. Upon hearing this, Ramanujan replied that 1729 was a really interesting number as it is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of 2 different cubes in exactly 2 different ways.</li>
                        <li class="item">Ramanujan, in his notebooks, had mentioned 17 different ways to express 1/pi as an infinite series, which gives 3.141592 after the first term only and keep on adding 8 correct digits thereafter.</li>
                        <li class="item">He gave his own theory of the divergent series, where he found a value for the sum of such series by using a method that he invented, which came to be known as Ramanujan summation.</li>
                        <li class="item">He made promising advances in the field of Partitions, i.e., the number of ways that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of positive integers.</li>
                        <li class="item">He worked out the Riemann series, the elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, the functional equations of the zeta function.</li>
